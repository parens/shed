Why is it so hard?
Your tender neck
Your taunting smirk
Anticipation
My heart's at work

You wash me in your yellow river
Flowing like our love
My mind once trapped in hell
Your body lifts above

Your thigh against mine
Saliva flowing like the Rhine
Like my hand beneath your hair
And down your underwear

Our legs and torsos start to touch
Anticipation is too much
But still we have our scars
That's what makes love so hard
